# StudySync - Spaced Repetition Flashcard System

## Overview

StudySync is a modern flashcard application built with Next.js that implements a comprehensive spaced repetition learning system with evidence-based scheduling, gamification, and persistence.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Professional UI Enhancements

- **Visual streak indicators**: Fire icons and color coding for active/broken streaks
- **Practice calendar**: Monthly view of practice history with visual day markers
- **Streak statistics**: Current streak, longest streak, total practice days, average per week
- **Progress tracking**: XP, level progression, and performance metrics

### âœ… Gamification System

- **XP calculation**: Base points + interval bonuses for correct answers
- **Level progression**: Dynamic leveling based on accumulated XP
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bars and level displays
- **Session statistics**: Accuracy, streak, and performance metrics
- **Achievement tracking**: Longest streak records and milestone celebrations

### âœ… Persistence & Storage

- **Dual persistence**: Backend API + localStorage fallback
- **Learning state tracking**: Interval index, next review dates, success rates
- **Session progress**: Comprehensive session data and analytics
- **API integration**: Enhanced flashcard API with learning endpoints

### âœ… Enhanced Study Experience

- **Daily sessions**: Optimized card selection for effective learning
- **Success rate display**: Per-card performance metrics
- **Learning stages**: Visual representation of mastery progress
- **Session completion**: Detailed results and continuation options

### âœ… PDF â†’ Podcast Generation (Local Demo)

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Transform extracted PDF text into high-quality audio podcasts
- **Chapter-based Structure**: Automatically splits content into manageable audio chapters
- **Local Processing**: Uses `google-tts-api` + `ffmpeg-static` for local audio generation and stitching
- **Interactive Player**: Built-in audio player with chapter navigation, speed control, and download
- **Caching System**: Content-based caching to avoid re-generating identical podcasts
- **User Consent**: Confirmation dialog ensuring users have rights to convert content to audio
- **File Integration**: Generate podcasts directly from extracted PDF text in "My Files" section

**Note**: This feature is intended for local/demo use only. Ensure you have rights to convert content to audio before generation.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Files

- **`/lib/learning.ts`**: Complete spaced repetition algorithm implementation + streak management
- **`/components/StudyFlashcards.tsx`**: Enhanced study interface with gamification and streak tracking
- **`/components/StreakHistory.tsx`**: Practice history calendar and streak analytics display
- **`/app/assistant/page.tsx`**: Updated dashboard with real-time streak statistics
- **`/lib/api.js`**: Extended API client with learning persistence and streak endpoints

### Algorithm Details

- **Scheduling Function**: `scheduleNextReview()` - Updates card learning state
- **Session Selection**: `selectDailySession()` - Selects optimal daily card set
- **Streak Management**: `updateStreakData()` - Tracks daily practice and maintains streaks
- **Streak Detection**: `checkStreakStatus()` - Identifies broken streaks and resets counters
- **XP Calculation**: Dynamic point system with interval-based bonuses
- **Level System**: Progressive difficulty and achievement tracking

### Streak System Details

1. **Daily Practice Tracking**: Each completed study session updates streak data
2. **Consecutive Day Logic**: Practicing today and tomorrow maintains streak
3. **Streak Breaking**: Missing more than 1 day automatically resets streak to 0
4. **Visual Feedback**: Dashboard shows current streak status with countdown timer
5. **Historical Data**: Calendar view displays practice history for motivation
6. **Statistics**: Tracks current streak, longest streak, total practice days, and averages

### Persistence Strategy

1. **Primary**: Backend API calls for centralized data storage
2. **Fallback**: localStorage for offline capability and reliability
3. **State Management**: Real-time updates with optimistic UI

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Server (for podcast generation):

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install google-tts-api fluent-ffmpeg ffmpeg-static --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   Client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access Application**: http://localhost:3001

3. **Study Flow**:

   - Cards are automatically selected based on spaced repetition
   - Answer cards to advance through learning stages
   - Earn XP and level up based on performance
   - Track progress with detailed analytics

4. **Podcast Generation**:
   - Go to "My Files" and upload a PDF
   - Extract text from the PDF
   - Click "Generate Podcast" to create audio version
   - Play in the built-in player or download the MP3
