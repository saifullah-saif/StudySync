Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the development of algorithms that can automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error with rewards

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles

Machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the problem being solved.
