                        I am providing you with study material extracted from a PDF. 
                        Your task is to create a set of high-quality flashcards in Q&A format. 

                        Rules:
                        - Focus on the most important concepts, definitions, and explanations.  
                        - Make questions clear, concise, and student-friendly.  
                        - Make answers accurate, but not overly long (1â€“3 sentences max).  
                        - If the text contains lists, formulas, or examples, turn them into direct Q&A.  
                        - Avoid trivial questions like "What is mentioned in paragraph 1".  
                        - Provide the output as a JSON array of objects with "question" and "answer".  

                        Here is the study material:
                        """  
                        ${pdfText}  
                        """
                        `,
            },
        ],
        temperature: 0.7
        });
        return response.output_text
    } catch(error: any){
        if (error?.status === 429){
            throw new Error('RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED');
        }
        throw error;
    }
}
