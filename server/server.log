Magnetic Disk 
 
A  magnetic  disk  is  a  storage  device  that  uses  a  magnetization  process  to  write, 
rewrite and access data. It is covered with a magnetic coating and stores data in the 
form of tracks, and sectors. Magnetic disks are flat circular plates of metal or plastic, 
coated on both sides with iron oxide. Input signals, which may be audio, video, or 
data, are recorded on the surface of a disk as magnetic patterns or spots in circular 
or spiral  tracks. The  data  on  a  magnetic  disk  is  read  and  written  using  a 
magnetization process. There's  just  a  large  shiny,  circular  "plate"  of  magnetic 
material called a platter, divided into billions of tiny areas. Each one of those areas 
can  be  independently  magnetized  (to  store  a  1)  or  demagnetized  (to  store  a  0). 
Magnetism is used in computer storage because it goes on storing information even 
when the power is switched off. 
Hard  disks,  zip  disks  and  floppy  disks  are  common  examples  of  magnetic  disks. 
Magnetic disks have traditionally been used as primary storage in computers. With 
the advent of solid-state drives (SSDs), magnetic disks are no longer considered the 
only option, but are still commonly used. 
 
On a disk we can perform two operations. One is a read another one is write. These 
plates  look  thing  is  knows  as  platter.  Separata  disks  are  there,  they  are  known as 
platters. All these platters are rigidly fixed on the central rod known as spindle rod. 
Spindle rod is the central rod where disk platters are rigidly connected/ That means 
all the disks will rotate when the spindle rod will rotate. This is call read-write arms. 
At  the  tip  of  the  arms,  there  are  read-write  heads  on  there. On  the  disks,  we  can 
perform read- write operation on both sides. We know there are two sides on a disk, 
up side and down side and we can perform read- write on both the sides. That’s why 
read-write arms have read- write heads on both sides of the disks. These read- write 
heads can move front and back direction. And slightly right and left so that the disk 
surface can be accessed. In combination  of spindle rod  rotation, and movement of 
read-write head, full disk data can be accessed. Data is organized on the disk in the 
form of tracks and sectors, where tracks are the circular divisions of the disk. Tracks 
are  further  divided  into  sectors  that  contain  blocks  of  data.  All  read  and  write 
operations on the magnetic disk are performed on the sectors.  
On a disk, we are having some concentric circles, and they are known as tracks. The 
thinner the tracks, the more storage. The data bits are recorded as tiny magnetic spots 
on the tracks.  

And  the  disk  will  be  divided  radially  into  multiple  zones. Each  zone  is  known  as 
sector. So, we  can  say, the disk  is  having  co-ordinate  system.  This  co-ordinate 
system will consist tracks and sectors. All the tracks available on the all the surfaces 
having the same radius is called a cylinder. There will be tracks of different radius 
on each disk, so there will be tracks of same radius on each disk. And they will form 
cylinder. Form the count of cylinder. We can understand how many tracks are there 
in total disk.  
Allocation  unit: The  portion  of  the  track,  enclosed  within  a  sector,  is  known  as 
allocation  unit.  A  hard  disk  can  have  2Kb  of  allocation  unit  size.  Remember  one 
thing,  allocation  unit cannot be  partially  allocated. Example: when  we  open  a  text 
file , and write hello world there, we will see, the size of the file is only 10 Bytes, 
and we save that file, you will notice that your total hard disk will be reduced by size 
not by the size of the file of 10Bytes rather by the size of the allocation unit. That 
means 2KB. So, either it will be allocated totally or not all. 
Read – Write Mechanism: 
 
We  have magnetic bubbles in  the disk,  and this  magnetic bubbles or  magnetic 
particles, these bubbles will be on the up direction or in the down direction which 
will indicate either 0 or 1. There magnetic particles are used in disk surface to hold 
data.  In  case  or write  operation,  through  this  particular  read-write  arms,  and  to  e 
specific through this read-write head, electric current will flow and due to the flow 
of  the current, magnetic  field will  be  generated.  Due  to the  presence  of  magnetic 
field, the magnetic particles will align accordingly, north-south or south north 
orientation, that will indicate whether it is holding the value 0 or 1. In case of read 
operation, these aligned magnetic particles will produce a magnetic particles in the 
read-write head and that read-write  head, due to  presence of magnetic field, will 
have  some  micro – current and  the  current direction  will  indicate  whether  it  has 
read 0 or whether it has read 1. 
Outcomes: 
There are three outcomes are possible from these read and write operations. One is 
successful,  another  one  is  partial  and  the  last  one  is  total  failure.  Successful  read-
write means we have done the operation fruitfully. Partial means some of the disk 
data are falling on the bad sector. Bad sector means it cannot contain data. Or if you 
write data there, you cannot restore that one. In this case, we have a partial failure. 
These are the total outcomes. 
 

Disk Partition: 
Logical partition: A disk can be partitioned into multiple drives. In our pc, we 
usually partition out total hard disk into multiple drives. There are also, some 
softwares and by using them, we can partition our disk space into multiple drives 
and this is called as logical partition. 
Physical Partition: When we will have multiple disks operating in a same system 
then it will be called as physical partition. 
 
Bad Sector: 
We have magnetic bubbles in the disk, and this magnetic bubbles or magnetic 
particles, these bubbles will be on the up direction or in the down direction which 
will indicate either 0 or 1. There magnetic particles are used in disk surface to hold 
data, but for some reason they might have lost their magnetic property. Then what 
will happen, when we will write or read data from there, they will not be affected 
by magnetic fields. IF the magnetic particle of disk surface lost its magnetic 
property, then we cannot affect its alignment north-south or south – north. Then it 
will form bad- sector. 
 
Reasons of Bad-Sector: 
If you do the hammering on the disk, if some spark can be taken place on room if 
you drop the hard-disk from your hand on the floor, then the disk can be hurt can be 
affected so what magnetic property can be lost.
